# protocol-decoder

This is the tool I had made back in 2016. The purpose of it, was to decode protocols of on-line games (compiled with asm.js) which were used to create a communication between the game and the server via binary WebSockets.



You can try demo version here: https://terjanq.github.io/tools/protocol-decoder/
